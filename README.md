## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project includes:

- A **full-stack web application** for analyzing and visualizing spatial correlations between natural disasters in Greece.
- A separate set of **scripts** used to extract structured event data from public Greek government documents using **LLMs** and fuzzy matching.
- A **dataset** generated by the scripts, used to populate the spatial database connected to the app.

## 📦 What’s Included in This Repository

- `data/` — contains the **structured dataset** created through preprocessing and used in the application’s database.
- `scripts/` — standalone Python scripts for:
  - 📄 Extracting event data from unstructured Greek government PDFs using **LLMs**
  - 🎯 Normalizing entities with **fuzzy matching**

> **Note:** The scripts are not integrated into the app. The extraction and data preparation were done separately prior to inserting the dataset into the database.

## 💻 Application Features

The web application was developed with **Node.js** (backend) and **React** (frontend). It connects to a **PostgreSQL/PostGIS** spatial database and supports:

- 🔍 Advanced filtering and spatial queries
- 📍 Cartographic (map-based) representation of disaster events
- 🔗 Graph-based visualization of interdependencies and cascading effects
- 📊 Event comparison across location and time
- 🔁 Import/export functionality
- 🌐 RESTful API endpoints

## 🧠 Abstract

Natural disasters are an inherent part of our planet and are beyond human control. However, their impact can be mitigated through the analysis of past events, understanding their causes and interactions, and implementing appropriate preventive and management measures.

Although vast information about natural disasters exists, it is often scattered and unstructured, making systematic analysis difficult. This thesis aims to bridge that gap by developing a web-based application for the **collection**, **processing**, **analysis**, and **visualization** of natural disaster data specific to Greece.

Data was extracted from publicly available government documents using **LLMs**, then cleaned and normalized via **fuzzy matching**. The resulting structured dataset was stored in a **spatial database**, and the application enables analysis of disaster relationships, such as **cascading effects** (where one event triggers another).
